# 📘 Project Milestones

### Role-Based E-Commerce Management System (In-Memory)

---

## 🧩 Milestone 1: Basic Project Setup

*Goal:* Application skeleton

* Create Dynamic Web Project
* Configure Tomcat
* Create basic folder structure
* Create home page + login page (JSP)

✔ No security yet
✔ Just navigation works

---

## 🧩 Milestone 2: In-Memory Data Setup

*Goal:* Replace database with memory

* Create in-memory collections for:

  * Users (admin, sub-admin)
  * Products
  * Categories
  * Shopkeepers
* Store collections in *ServletContext*

✔ Data shared across app
✔ Data lost on server restart (expected)

---

## 🧩 Milestone 3: Login (Authentication)

*Goal:* Identify the user

* Create LoginServlet
* Validate username & password from in-memory users
* Create `HttpSession`
* Store:

  * username
  * role (ADMIN / SUB_ADMIN)
* Redirect to role-specific dashboard

✔ Session created
✔ User is “logged in”

---

## 🧩 Milestone 4: Logout + Cache Control

*Goal:* Secure logout

* Implement LogoutServlet
* Call `session.invalidate()`
* Set cache-control headers
* Redirect to login page

✔ Back button should not show secure pages

---

## 🧩 Milestone 5: Authentication Filter

*Goal:* Protect application

* Create AuthFilter
* Check:

  * Is session present?
  * Is user logged in?
* If not → redirect to login

✔ No unauthenticated access

---

## 🧩 Milestone 6: Authorization Filter (Role-Based)

*Goal:* Control permissions

* Extend filter logic:

  * Admin-only URLs
  * Sub-admin-only URLs
* Block unauthorized roles
* Redirect to access-denied page

✔ Role-based security enforced

---

## 🧩 Milestone 7: Admin Features

*Goal:* Admin-only operations

* Add / modify / delete shopkeepers
* Add categories
* View shopkeepers list
* View products list

✔ Admin URLs protected by filter

---

## 🧩 Milestone 8: Sub-Admin Features

*Goal:* Sub-admin-only operations

* Change own password
* Add / modify / delete products
* View product list

✔ Sub-admin URLs protected by filter

---

## 🧩 Milestone 9: JSP + JSTL Integration

*Goal:* Clean UI layer

* Display lists using `<c:forEach>`
* Use `<c:out>` for safe output
* Avoid Java logic in JSP

✔ MVC discipline reinforced

---

## 🧩 Milestone 10: Final Flow Validation

*Goal:* Confidence & clarity

* Verify:

  * Login → dashboard
  * Unauthorized URL access blocked
  * Session maintained across requests
  * Logout clears access
* Discuss:

  * Why sessions are needed
  * Why filters are required

✔ Conceptual clarity achieved
