## 📘 Problem Statement

### Role-Based E-Commerce Management System (In-Memory)

Design and implement a *simple e-commerce management web application* using *Servlets, Filters, JSP, and HTTP Sessions*, *without using a database*.

The application must support *two user roles*:
*Admin* and *Sub-Admin*, with *role-based access control*.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement:

* *Authentication* (login/logout)
* *Authorization* (role-based access)
* *Session management*
* *Security using filters*
* *In-memory data handling*

---

## 🔐 User Roles & Responsibilities

### 👤 Admin

* Login to the system
* Add shopkeepers
* Modify shopkeepers
* Delete shopkeepers
* View list of all shopkeepers
* View list of products

---

### 👤 Sub-Admin

* Login to the system
* Add products
* Modify products
* Delete products
* View list of products

---

## 🔒 Security Requirements

* Only *authenticated users* can access protected pages.
* *Authorization must be enforced using Filters*:

  * Admin-only URLs blocked for Sub-Admin
  * Sub-Admin-only URLs blocked for Admin
* Unauthorized access should redirect to an *error / login page*.

---

## 🧠 Session Management Requirements

* User login information (username, role) must be stored in *HttpSession*.
* Session must persist across multiple requests.
* Logout must:

  * Invalidate the session
  * Prevent browser back-button access (cache control).

---

## 🗂️ Data Storage Rules

* No database is allowed.
* Use *in-memory collections* (`List`, `Map`) to store:

  * Users
  * Categories
  * Products
  * Shopkeepers
* Data must be shared across the application using *ServletContext*.

---

## 🧩 Technical Constraints

* Servlets → Controller logic
* JSP + JSTL → Display only
* Filters → Authentication & Authorization
* Sessions → User state
* No frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome (Very Important)

After completing this project, students should clearly understand:

* Why sessions are needed
* How filters secure applications
* Difference between authentication and authorization
* How real web applications control access

---

## One-line Summary

> *This project shows how a web application remembers users and restricts actions based on roles.*
